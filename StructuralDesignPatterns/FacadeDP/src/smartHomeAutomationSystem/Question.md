# Practical scenario involving a smart home automation system:

Imagine you're building a smart home system that needs to control various devices from different manufacturers (Phillips lights, Nest thermostats, Ring security cameras, and smart locks). Each device has its own complex API and methods:

- Lights have methods like setPower(), setBrightness(), setColor()
- Thermostats have setTemperature(), setMode(), setSchedule()
- Security cameras have startRecording(), stopRecording(), motionDetection()
- Smart locks have lock(), unlock(), checkStatus()

The challenge is that:
1. Each device has different method names and implementations
2. Mobile app developers need a simple, unified way to control all these devices
3. The system should be able to easily add new types of devices in the future
4. Home automation routines need to control multiple devices with simple commands like "Good Morning" or "Good Night"

Your task is to create a HomeAutomationFacade that simplifies these complex subsystems into easy-to-use methods like:
- turnOnLights()
- turnOffLights()
- setEveningMode()
- setAwayMode()
- setHomeMode()

This way, the client code (mobile app) doesn't need to know about the complexity of each device's API and can control the entire home through simple, intuitive methods.

Would you like to implement this scenario? It's particularly good because it:
- Represents a real-world problem developers actually face
- Shows clear benefit of hiding complexity
- Demonstrates interface simplification
- Is easily extensible
- Is something most people can relate to
